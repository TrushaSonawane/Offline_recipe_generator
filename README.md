# 🍓 Strawberry Recipe Picker

Offline recipe generator — **fast, light, and fun.**  
Built with **Python + Tkinter**, this desktop app helps you discover recipes based on the ingredients you have and the time you’ve got.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🔍 **Ingredient filtering**: Enter ingredients (comma-separated) to get exact matches.  
- ⏱️ **Cooking time filter**: Set a maximum cooking time to only see recipes that fit your schedule.  
- 🎲 **Surprise Me Mode**: Let the app pick a random recipe for you.  
- ➕ **Add Recipe**: Easily expand your personal cookbook via a built-in recipe form.  
- 📂 **Local-first**: Recipes are stored in a JSON file (`recipes_local.json`) so everything works offline.
